# Retail Business Performance & Profitability Analysis

## Objective
The objective of this project is to analyze transactional retail data in order to:
- Identify profit-draining categories and sub-categories
- Optimize inventory turnover rates
- Uncover seasonal product performance trends
- Provide strategic insights for better stock and sales decisions

---

## Tools Used
- *SQL (SQLite via Google Colab)* â€“ For data aggregation and business logic queries
- *Python (Pandas, Seaborn)* â€“ For exploratory data analysis and correlation insights
- *Power BI* â€“ For building an interactive dashboard with filters and KPIs

## Dashboard Features
Built using Power BI:
- *Profit Margin Analysis* by Category and Sub-Category
- *Seasonal Trends* (Line Chart)
- *Region-wise Performance* (Map or Bar)
- *Slow-Moving Low-Profit Items* (Table)
- *Filters* for Region, Category, and Season
- *KPI Cards* for Total Sales, Total Profit, and Avg. Inventory Days

---

## Key Insights
- Categories with low profit margins and high inventory holding costs were identified
- Seasonal spikes in certain product types helped define demand windows
- Overstocked items with low profitability were highlighted for clearance strategies
- Suggestions were made for improving category-level performance and stock rotation

---

## Real-Time Potential
Though this project uses static CSV files, it can be extended to real-time by:
- Connecting Power BI to a live SQL database or Google Sheets
- Scheduling automatic refresh in Power BI Service
- Integrating data collection via forms, apps, or POS systems
